0:0:0.0 --> 0:0:0.340
Josh Sommer
You're right.
0:0:-2.-370 --> 0:0:0.720
Muneer Mubashir
Be be say nice things everyone so.
0:0:3.60 --> 0:0:12.810
Muneer Mubashir
No. Go ahead. God, Josh, I know you made the you made the the the interest. I don't know if you have. If you have met everyone or or everyone's familiar. First question urban is.
0:0:13.560 --> 0:0:17.760
Muneer Mubashir
Yeah, it does. Does, is Kelsey familiar a familiar name or not?
0:0:19.750 --> 0:0:20.200
Muneer Mubashir
Yeah.
0:0:18.170 --> 0:0:20.600
Rens, Erwin van
The name yes. Yes, of course. Yes, of course. No.
0:0:20.420 --> 0:0:22.10
Quelsea Johnson
Yes, good.
0:0:21.650 --> 0:0:46.840
Rens, Erwin van
I I actually you know your company is is familiar you know pkisolutions and and Mark, Mark. Mark and I we we've connected I think maybe 10 years ago already you know he's he's a world renowned specialist in the 8 CS area so yeah and I've been I've been following your organization for for quite a while to be honest.
0:0:47.800 --> 0:0:51.930
Rens, Erwin van
I I still have some some of course vouchers open actually.
0:0:53.250 --> 0:1:24.730
Rens, Erwin van
And one of the one of the the quizzes that Mark held, you know I got awarded 22 vouchers for your courses. I haven't traded him in yet, so I'll I'll probably should be doing that, but I I am I'm not necessarily directly active with with a DCS at the moment I do some PKI consulting for customers but not necessarily a a DCS specific. ACS is just one of these solutions that DXC.
0:1:24.830 --> 0:1:30.90
Rens, Erwin van
Office to their customers and main, mostly in most of the scenarios, it's where.
0:1:31.310 --> 0:1:58.930
Rens, Erwin van
Where they already have an ADC S instance and they need guidance on, you know, tightening it, securing it, renewing it or operationalizing it. So that's when when Adcs comes into play and the majority of our customers, we are now moving towards you know more cloud delivered solutions, a lot of vendors nowadays also support, you know, automatic enrollment and you know.
0:1:59.570 --> 0:2:7.0
Rens, Erwin van
Umm. Key vault from Azure and all these kind of functionalities that make the management and use of certificates more easy.
0:2:8.20 --> 0:2:15.330
Rens, Erwin van
And now not just supported by ACS, but also by various suppliers, you know. So yeah, that's.
0:2:16.770 --> 0:2:19.710
Rens, Erwin van
But it's in a nutshell. Yeah, we'll talk. I've been. I've been.
0:2:21.520 --> 0:2:24.510
Rens, Erwin van
Keeping an eye on on your organization for a bit longer.
0:2:26.540 --> 0:2:27.60
Muneer Mubashir
Excellent.
0:2:28.900 --> 0:2:40.410
Muneer Mubashir
So, so one of the things that when when Josh mentioned that, you know, Irvine's Urban's willing to the dock to us as like OK, perfect, perfect, because one of the things that we've been doing and looking at is.
0:2:41.430 --> 0:2:55.180
Muneer Mubashir
Like broad stroke and and we're we're calling this like our series of of jobs to be done. Insights. And and you're you're you're the first one we are interviewing in that series. So thank you you're you're a pioneer there.
0:2:56.860 --> 0:3:2.920
Muneer Mubashir
And our objective really is to kind of step back and and say for someone in your role.
0:3:3.540 --> 0:3:18.130
Muneer Mubashir
What are the critical jobs to be done when it comes to cyber security when it comes to compliance and the second piece is how do we see a, you know, PKI play a role in that?
0:3:38.390 --> 0:3:38.790
Rens, Erwin van
Umm.
0:3:18.980 --> 0:3:48.510
Muneer Mubashir
Both as an enabler of security and enabler of business use cases, and then second also, yeah, when you have a PKI, you potentially have keys to the Kingdom as well. And then and then how what are your thoughts on on PKI and and with ADQ CS as a possible attack service, right? We're misconfigurations can be exploitable and so on and so forth. So that's kind of where we wanted to start off with this. I'm hoping we'll influence a few things.
0:3:53.780 --> 0:3:54.120
Rens, Erwin van
Umm.
0:3:48.950 --> 0:4:18.630
Muneer Mubashir
Uh, what we do with PKI? Spotlight as a right, as a product category, what content we generate so that we can be useful and something I love about working with PKI solutions is everyone wants to create useful content. We're not in the business of just, you know, opening up, you know, digital space and and and and putting you know garbage out there to be to be transparent we wanna put out content that that resonates. So that was kind of like the the gist of it. So if we could just step back and.
0:4:18.950 --> 0:4:25.80
Muneer Mubashir
Understand. Like your your critical jobs to be done and responsibilities and then we can kind of get into some of the other stuff.
0:4:32.710 --> 0:4:33.170
Muneer Mubashir
Yeah.
0:4:26.140 --> 0:4:33.280
Rens, Erwin van
Well, if from from my view this it's mainly my views not necessarily be excessive of course. But in in my view.
0:4:34.520 --> 0:4:45.640
Rens, Erwin van
What you see on the market nowadays is a very fragmented cybersecurity business that's being that's popping up over everywhere. There's a lot of companies that come up with point solutions.
0:4:46.900 --> 0:4:53.550
Rens, Erwin van
And let's say you know they they they take care of a part of the whole shape, security threat landscape.
0:4:54.890 --> 0:4:58.230
Rens, Erwin van
And all the all trying to eat a a piece of the pie, to be honest.
0:4:59.810 --> 0:5:5.100
Rens, Erwin van
And in in my view in order you know to look if if you look at a customer or a company.
0:5:6.480 --> 0:5:7.580
Rens, Erwin van
It it it?
0:5:9.220 --> 0:5:23.770
Rens, Erwin van
Whatever tools they are using is not necessarily that important. What is important is determining the threat landscape and the attack surface of that company and where are your areas of concern when it comes to securing.
0:5:25.410 --> 0:5:27.280
Rens, Erwin van
For example, a trucking company.
0:5:27.880 --> 0:5:42.840
Rens, Erwin van
And do they really have data to protect? Well, they have some customer data, of course, but some financial data. But if that is, if that is leaked, you know the the the business doesn't stop the business only stops with the trucks start rolling stop rolling right.
0:5:44.190 --> 0:6:17.590
Rens, Erwin van
So there, there threat appetite and it actually is a lot different from for example, a logistics company that delivers parcels to people no, if their business stops, then people don't get their their the orders anymore and it's completely different from a healthcare provider. They have a significant amount of very critical data that they need to protect and also you know it depends on how you are handling that data. If you keep everything internal and you do not have exposed Internet exposed systems.
0:6:32.360 --> 0:6:32.590
Muneer Mubashir
No.
0:6:18.40 --> 0:6:41.380
Rens, Erwin van
No threat landscape is completely different from a from an online online dentist practice that that accepts, you know, new appointments in these kind of things. So it, in my view the the first step to be taken is to analyze, you know, where are your, where are your weaknesses, where are your points of entry, where are your?
0:6:43.340 --> 0:6:43.930
Rens, Erwin van
Your.
0:6:45.300 --> 0:6:50.850
Rens, Erwin van
Openings for somebody to to access your information. That's all about your information.
0:6:51.820 --> 0:6:54.550
Rens, Erwin van
Right. Whatever information I have, it's all about your information.
0:6:55.330 --> 0:6:56.490
Rens, Erwin van
So if you know.
0:6:58.90 --> 0:7:27.640
Rens, Erwin van
What information you have and how that information can potentially be accessed through an end users PC or through an Internet web page or whatever, then you can start looking at you know, what do I need to protect? What if that information is actually worth protecting in the 1st place? And the second thing is then what is the best way to protect that? Sometimes you build a fence around it, sometimes you encrypt it, sometimes you don't even expose it to the outside.
0:7:28.60 --> 0:7:49.300
Rens, Erwin van
I mean, I am absolutely sure that your online bank, for example through your banking app, the banking app will not have direct access to your account to the system that processes your account. It will have an extract, it will have a near real time copy of it, but it will not be able to communicate directly with that system. There will always be something in between that checks everything off.
0:7:50.490 --> 0:7:50.970
Rens, Erwin van
So.
0:7:51.840 --> 0:7:53.710
Rens, Erwin van
It's it's all about determining risk.
0:7:54.540 --> 0:8:2.480
Rens, Erwin van
So where are your risks and what is your risk appetite? Which risks do you want to mitigate? Which risks do you want to accept?
0:8:3.450 --> 0:8:11.720
Rens, Erwin van
You should you. Sometimes you can only accept the risk. You cannot rule out, you know, a ransomware outbreak. It'll happen.
0:8:12.620 --> 0:8:37.250
Rens, Erwin van
Can't just does that there are companies now that say ohh we can, we can guarantee you 100% security. That's impossible. You can't do that. You know the things will happen. What you do when it happens. That is what is important, right? What measures have you taken to prevent it from happening to to make the to make the risk as small as possible and what have what will are you able to do if it still happens anyway.
0:8:38.600 --> 0:8:58.410
Rens, Erwin van
No, and that's where you know that is the the approach that I am typically taking. So look at look at your, you know what do you have, what what is worth protecting, right? How can somebody actually get unauthorized access to that to that information to whatever we're trying to protect.
0:8:59.550 --> 0:9:11.980
Rens, Erwin van
What do you have already in place in order to protect it? You might already have some good locks. Or where do we need to improve and where does it make financially and business wise good sense to actually do some improvements?
0:9:13.60 --> 0:9:21.250
Rens, Erwin van
No, we shouldn't throw a huge firewalls at at small businesses because it doesn't make sense, you know, and they can spend their money elsewhere and and.
0:9:23.590 --> 0:9:29.40
Rens, Erwin van
Did they don't need a big a big 40 gate in order to protect their data. They can do that in a in another way.
0:9:30.260 --> 0:9:35.380
Rens, Erwin van
So where do where do quickly eyes and certificates come into play?
0:9:37.460 --> 0:9:40.520
Rens, Erwin van
Speaker, it's a difficult are protection mechanisms. They are.
0:9:41.400 --> 0:9:48.40
Rens, Erwin van
Uh, you know the the ground force to encrypting your data or providing secure access to your data.
0:9:51.280 --> 0:9:59.40
Rens, Erwin van
Main you know, most obvious thing of course, are you know you're SSL web certificates and the stuff that you do with VPN and these kind of things.
0:10:0.370 --> 0:10:8.790
Rens, Erwin van
But also internally, you know there's there are a lot of capabilities that are currently not being used by companies because they don't know how to use them.
0:10:10.10 --> 0:10:19.960
Rens, Erwin van
BitLocker for example can can be used with a digital certificate. You can deploy a certificate to a machine and then use that for your BitLocker encryption and that that greatly.
0:10:21.350 --> 0:10:32.10
Rens, Erwin van
Simplifies your potential recovery. You don't have to keep every all of these individual recovery keys in your Active Directory, which is again the potential attack area.
0:10:33.600 --> 0:10:36.300
Rens, Erwin van
And if you don't have them, then you don't need to protect them, right?
0:10:37.490 --> 0:10:48.100
Rens, Erwin van
But also you know smart card logons. There's only very few companies that are actually using smart card logons with, you know, PKI generates certificates on it for end user logons.
0:10:49.660 --> 0:10:54.400
Rens, Erwin van
And that is all, because it is perceived as a difficult.
0:10:56.130 --> 0:11:20.20
Rens, Erwin van
You know it's it's it's another world that handles all these things. So making it simplifying, simplifying the use and I should share that they operationalizing a digital certificate for a certain purpose because a digital certificate itself doesn't do anything. It always needs something else to make it functional, to make it worthwhile.
0:11:21.220 --> 0:11:30.300
Rens, Erwin van
Or to exploit this value and so. But if if we if we are in a way of simplifying that making it easy.
0:11:32.500 --> 0:11:45.930
Rens, Erwin van
Then I think the the use cases and the use of PPI's in general in businesses apart from there SSL certificate and their VPN concentrator certificate maybe will greatly increase.
0:11:46.800 --> 0:11:47.250
Rens, Erwin van
No.
0:11:48.510 --> 0:11:52.920
Rens, Erwin van
I'll give you a very nice example. When Microsoft released SCCM.
0:11:53.740 --> 0:11:58.330
Rens, Erwin van
They started also allowing Internet based systems management.
0:11:59.190 --> 0:12:7.500
Rens, Erwin van
But it requires you to deploy a big eyes, difficult to your endpoints because that endpoint would communicate over the Internet whether your device using a certificate.
0:12:8.590 --> 0:12:31.380
Rens, Erwin van
That that's why it never really started working, you know, because it was perceived very difficult. You had to have a PKI after deploy your certificates and manage it and everything else. So when they started using the, what is it? The cloud based management point when all of that certificate stuff started moving, you know, started being taken away from them.
0:12:32.610 --> 0:12:39.220
Rens, Erwin van
Then suddenly Internet based machine management, you know, took off much wider than they ever thought possible.
0:12:40.290 --> 0:12:43.950
Rens, Erwin van
Alright, so if you make it more convenient, more easy, more simple.
0:12:45.890 --> 0:12:48.770
Rens, Erwin van
I think it'll be be taken on a lot, lot better.
0:12:50.290 --> 0:13:9.140
Rens, Erwin van
Now that also of course means that it is. It's very it becomes very important to protect your PKI, right? We all know that if you're, if you're a Shia keys or some of that information is compromised, then you know the value of your PKI is completely, completely gone.
0:13:10.700 --> 0:13:18.540
Rens, Erwin van
So protecting the keys is becomes critical. I I think the Microsoft OS does already a pretty good job with the key store.
0:13:20.230 --> 0:13:37.400
Rens, Erwin van
Compared to for example Linux or Unix based operating systems where keys are basically just files on your file system and you have to put an ACL in the file system to protect them, there's no other way in in in in Unix like systems to protect your keys apart from a file system ACL.
0:13:39.40 --> 0:13:53.410
Rens, Erwin van
So you know, on on the window side, it's already a lot better and but I think that it is it's you know if if if your company floats on on PKI and PKI services I think.
0:13:55.590 --> 0:13:57.850
Rens, Erwin van
3 pillars would be would be.
0:13:59.710 --> 0:14:3.950
Rens, Erwin van
Would be useful. One is 1 is of course simplifying the use.
0:14:6.730 --> 0:14:9.770
Rens, Erwin van
Making making the use cases for certificates easier.
0:14:10.630 --> 0:14:11.80
Rens, Erwin van
Right.
0:14:12.210 --> 0:14:13.660
Rens, Erwin van
Show that the.
0:14:15.60 --> 0:14:24.30
Rens, Erwin van
The adoption of a certificate for a certain purpose becomes becomes bigger. You end user certificates, you know endpoint, certificates etcetera.
0:14:25.430 --> 0:14:47.900
Rens, Erwin van
The second thing would be how do I protect that that infrastructure in in the best way should that it is available and and secure that no unauthorized use can be done with it. And the third thing of course is making sure that you will have always a good insight on the status of your of your environment that you can detect breach that you can detect tampering.
0:14:50.400 --> 0:15:4.30
Rens, Erwin van
Unfortunately, HSM are still extremely expensive and most of the companies that that your customers I work with, they don't necessarily see the necessity to spend that $100,000 a year for managing that HSM.
0:15:6.570 --> 0:15:12.80
Rens, Erwin van
But on the other side, you know if if you are able to to elaborate on the importance of it.
0:15:13.20 --> 0:15:22.200
Rens, Erwin van
And show what can happen if you know if keys are compromised, you know then then typically they are able they are willing to to still spend, spend the money so.
0:15:23.390 --> 0:15:25.0
Rens, Erwin van
But again, because it's it is all.
0:15:26.360 --> 0:15:32.690
Rens, Erwin van
Surrounded with a with a with a bit of a, you know, FUD, fear, uncertainty and doubt.
0:15:33.580 --> 0:15:38.70
Rens, Erwin van
And I think the major certificate vendors have have contributed to that.
0:15:39.70 --> 0:15:49.290
Rens, Erwin van
You know, to keep their markets take, if you don't tell people how easy it is to to, you know, to to work with this difference, then they will come. Keep coming to you to to to handle that.
0:15:50.750 --> 0:15:53.0
Rens, Erwin van
So simplifying that is.
0:15:53.770 --> 0:15:54.880
Rens, Erwin van
I think it will help.
0:15:57.110 --> 0:16:0.560
Rens, Erwin van
You know the on boarding of of certificate use.
0:16:7.300 --> 0:16:7.720
Josh Sommer
Yeah.
0:16:7.730 --> 0:16:11.240
Muneer Mubashir
Wow. Yeah, go. There's a lot.
0:16:9.180 --> 0:16:11.370
Josh Sommer
Yeah, that now you got.
0:16:12.320 --> 0:16:14.940
Muneer Mubashir
Yeah, this there's a lot to unpack there from an.
0:16:15.60 --> 0:16:42.890
Muneer Mubashir
A what I what I would love to kind of, you know, get a feel from you here because you talked about the three pillars, right. You talked about making adoption easy. You talked about making sure things are that infrastructure itself is operational, resilient, secure and then you're looking at right, it's more of hey, is everything normal? Right is is everything or normal within the the PKI infrastructure coming back to like your.
0:16:44.250 --> 0:16:47.410
Muneer Mubashir
And and this is the thing I we hear all the time is.
0:16:48.160 --> 0:16:49.870
Muneer Mubashir
People don't understand.
0:16:50.900 --> 0:16:54.730
Muneer Mubashir
Or the leadership does not understand the value of a PKI.
0:16:55.600 --> 0:17:3.740
Muneer Mubashir
Uh in in terms of like securing or in terms of even like in an object or something that needs to be invested in?
0:17:3.950 --> 0:17:4.320
Rens, Erwin van
Umm.
0:17:8.780 --> 0:17:9.290
Rens, Erwin van
Oh yeah.
0:17:5.620 --> 0:17:10.560
Muneer Mubashir
Do you see that in your in your day-to-day, both internally within DXC and when you?
0:17:11.440 --> 0:17:18.830
Rens, Erwin van
Absolutely. I see healthcare providers here in Holland that go out and get let let's encrypted difficultes for their web pages.
0:17:20.170 --> 0:17:29.850
Rens, Erwin van
I see you know the most the most from my point. The most strange thing that happened very recently is, you know, in Holland we had a PKI government.
0:17:30.720 --> 0:17:36.470
Rens, Erwin van
Environment, we had a a dedicated externally trusted PKI hierarchy.
0:17:37.930 --> 0:17:54.990
Rens, Erwin van
That was signed by the Dutch Government and operated by the Dutch government. You know, that's an excellent opportunity for like the IRS service or other government related organizations to get certificates from, right. So they can identify themselves as a government entity.
0:17:55.940 --> 0:18:0.90
Rens, Erwin van
And you know and use that that identification as a protection mechanism as well.
0:18:1.250 --> 0:18:30.640
Rens, Erwin van
Government stopped. Stopped this this hierarchy because it was not much used. It was perceived costly, expensive certificates were they were a lot more expensive than normal mark certificates. So market parties, even government organizations. Station went to normal market parties to get their certificates from and and that's a bit odd because then the price becomes the the distinguishing factor instead of the trustworthiness that you imply on it.
0:18:31.510 --> 0:19:2.660
Rens, Erwin van
No government fails to, you know, to make a decree that says if you're a government organization and you want to protect your information, you have to use these certificates. They don't do that. So what happens? Organizations go through the cheapest vendor around. And because you you, it's very difficult to show the the value. The difference in value between the certificate from you know, let's encrypt or a T-shirt or whatever, you know, that means also means that it's it becomes very difficult.
0:19:2.750 --> 0:19:19.710
Rens, Erwin van
To to show the value that a PKI brings to an organization. That's what it's about. If you have an antivirus product and you can show that one antivirus product in can detect more malware coming through your system than another one, then you show your value right?
0:19:20.660 --> 0:19:21.10
Muneer Mubashir
Alright.
0:19:20.870 --> 0:19:38.810
Rens, Erwin van
If you if if you have a logging system that shows whatever is coming up, I mean that's why I I like Sentinel so much. You know, Sentinel uses detections from and you know and log information from all sorts of companies to generate to generate their their use cases or their reporting.
0:19:40.490 --> 0:19:42.0
Rens, Erwin van
Facilities so.
0:19:42.870 --> 0:19:44.800
Rens, Erwin van
If it can detect.
0:19:46.180 --> 0:20:5.590
Rens, Erwin van
Events and issues much faster than another system that you that runs on premise, but the sheer fact that it broaches much more data. So that's when the value can be demonstrated very easily. And I think it's all about, you know, demonstrating the value that PKI can bring to an organization.
0:20:6.400 --> 0:20:11.610
Rens, Erwin van
And I think that that should be done with, you know, real world examples. Where does it make sense?
0:20:21.800 --> 0:20:22.60
Rens, Erwin van
Umm.
0:20:14.590 --> 0:20:34.330
Muneer Mubashir
OK. And and coming back to that, that security pillar question that that we had and one of the things that we we see over and over again and I wanna share this with you, is the organizational maturity and if I look at the PKI person and they might say we they they have.
0:20:52.920 --> 0:20:53.260
Rens, Erwin van
Umm.
0:20:35.80 --> 0:21:5.790
Muneer Mubashir
Little visibility or understanding of how misconfigurations and can lead to you know can lead to someone exploiting right and and the thing that seems to drive that is that ohh the Spectre OPS report. I read the Spectre OPS report, it drove some awareness. How do you see how do you see the organizational maturity and basically understanding that? Look, there are misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in a DCS in.
0:21:5.870 --> 0:21:10.930
Muneer Mubashir
Take your eyes that can just kind of expose the entire organization. Do you? Do you see that?
0:21:11.620 --> 0:21:14.740
Muneer Mubashir
Awareness of of those misconfigurations? Or.
0:21:13.500 --> 0:21:20.920
Rens, Erwin van
No, I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't. I don't see that. I mean, you're already lucky if you find an organization where they have PKI guy.
0:21:21.930 --> 0:21:48.120
Rens, Erwin van
Right. And most cases it the use it. It's just about using certificates and that is delegated to a program manager that needs to get some function out there and they just go and request certificates. There are very few companies that have an internal certificate policy or a trust policy or some guidelines on you know, how do you request a certificate? How do you obtain a certificate, what can and cannot be used in a certificate.
0:21:49.490 --> 0:22:0.350
Rens, Erwin van
You know, I'm. I'm working for a large organization right now and they have no policy against use of wildcards and certificates. So basically any project can request startup company.com for them.
0:22:1.260 --> 0:22:1.570
Rens, Erwin van
Right.
0:22:2.200 --> 0:22:8.550
Rens, Erwin van
And if you're supplier doesn't care what you put in there because they trust that coming from is from a from a trusted.
0:22:9.910 --> 0:22:16.740
Rens, Erwin van
From the trusted IP address or a trusted mailbox. Then before you know it, you know 15 internal or maybe even external.
0:22:16.880 --> 0:22:21.320
Rens, Erwin van
I'm I'm websites may be running on the same Wild card certificate.
0:22:22.260 --> 0:22:30.570
Rens, Erwin van
So I I think all companies know that that certificates are needed for a certain purpose. But I think for a lot of the companies it stops there.
0:22:32.0 --> 0:22:51.290
Rens, Erwin van
And if you don't have a certificate policy, if you don't have certificate management, if you don't have a, you know a templates and information for your for your people on, you know, what can you do with a, with a certificate? What are you allowed to do with certificate and how should you operate and request one?
0:22:52.410 --> 0:22:55.950
Rens, Erwin van
You know, then it will start leading its own life and it becomes just a functional tool.
0:22:57.500 --> 0:23:1.830
Rens, Erwin van
I'm just screw screwdriver to make your, uh, to make your your application run.
0:23:3.200 --> 0:23:4.810
Rens, Erwin van
You know and.
0:23:4.980 --> 0:23:5.480
Muneer Mubashir
Excellent.
0:23:5.540 --> 0:23:16.880
Rens, Erwin van
And I'm I'm I'll say I I don't think that a lot of companies actually have an internal certificate environment. So 80 CS is is is it has a niche I think.
0:23:18.700 --> 0:23:27.670
Rens, Erwin van
Because why would you want to have an internal PKI in the 1st place, right? Only if you have a need to to have internally issued certificates.
0:23:30.160 --> 0:23:41.60
Rens, Erwin van
And that would that, would that need would would arise from from a certain maturity level of an organization that they say, OK, the only way we can do this is with a certificate.
0:23:45.340 --> 0:23:46.810
Rens, Erwin van
Yeah, I I think that is.
0:23:52.350 --> 0:24:1.90
Rens, Erwin van
If if you look at, you know capability of breach of leaking of data through through a DCS, I think first first you would need to have one.
0:24:2.250 --> 0:24:5.110
Rens, Erwin van
I think most companies probably don't have one.
0:24:6.160 --> 0:24:7.660
Rens, Erwin van
The larger ones should perhaps yes.
0:24:9.680 --> 0:24:10.410
Rens, Erwin van
But I think.
0:24:12.320 --> 0:24:18.510
Rens, Erwin van
I mean, how many organizations use a you know, certificate based Wi-Fi distribution?
0:24:19.600 --> 0:24:32.370
Rens, Erwin van
But it's that this is one of the reasons why some companies start putting internal PKI out there because they need to give the machine a certificate so it can connect to their, you know, enterprise WPA enterprise based.
0:24:34.60 --> 0:24:35.290
Rens, Erwin van
Wireless environment.
0:24:36.850 --> 0:24:38.30
Rens, Erwin van
I mean if.
0:24:38.840 --> 0:24:49.930
Rens, Erwin van
Probably if you look at your customers that use spotlight or some other tooling of yours on, you know for what purpose do they actually use that a DCS, I think it's gonna be very limited.
0:24:52.10 --> 0:24:52.320
Rens, Erwin van
Right.
0:24:53.220 --> 0:24:53.440
Muneer Mubashir
Right.
0:24:54.120 --> 0:24:54.690
Rens, Erwin van
And.
0:24:56.70 --> 0:25:1.560
Rens, Erwin van
Yes, if you misconfigured it, you can. You can easily, you know, do everything you want on the domain.
0:25:3.220 --> 0:25:9.250
Rens, Erwin van
But that goes much further. I mean, a general AD misconfigurations are still out there.
0:25:26.0 --> 0:25:26.300
Muneer Mubashir
Umm.
0:25:26.360 --> 0:25:54.270
Rens, Erwin van
Talk. OK. Abilities. There's very few companies that have NTLM version. One completely eradicated from their network. There's, you know, most companies still have not BIOS active. You know, nobody takes that little box that says do not use netbios anymore. So there's a lot of work that still needs to be done. I think Abcs security is, of course, one thing, but I think it's not gonna be very high on most companies priorities list.
0:25:56.390 --> 0:25:56.770
Muneer Mubashir
Yeah.
0:25:56.60 --> 0:25:57.730
Rens, Erwin van
It it's a tool, yeah.
0:26:0.110 --> 0:26:4.90
Muneer Mubashir
That's that's where we're we're running into and I wanted to kind of.
0:26:7.340 --> 0:26:7.620
Rens, Erwin van
Umm.
0:26:23.250 --> 0:26:23.630
Rens, Erwin van
Umm.
0:26:29.570 --> 0:26:29.820
Rens, Erwin van
Yeah.
0:26:5.340 --> 0:26:36.110
Muneer Mubashir
At run a scenario by you where this has where the the urgency has kicked in and and the urgency has kicked in and few of our accounts where a pen tester went in and that said let me now show you how you know they basically said let me run through your ADC S and let me show you how I can exploit this misconfiguration and do escalation of privileges and and that's where some of that like awareness has has kicked in when someone is actually.
0:26:37.830 --> 0:26:38.80
Rens, Erwin van
Yeah.
0:26:46.140 --> 0:26:46.910
Rens, Erwin van
Absolutely.
0:26:36.200 --> 0:26:47.330
Muneer Mubashir
Physically shown them what? What are your thoughts there? Is that something that you see with DXC or like how do you it just what are your thoughts on that tactic in in driving the awareness?
0:26:47.930 --> 0:27:11.450
Rens, Erwin van
Absolutely. In the security world, a lot of reactive, you know, people start looking at at the proper backup and recovery procedures when they got hit with ransomware and everything that encrypted and they've they discovered that they're backup is is also encrypted. It's the same thing. I mean there's there's so much things about putting good locks on your door.
0:27:12.750 --> 0:27:34.280
Rens, Erwin van
And I think with with everything that happened, a lot of companies, they do become aware that there is different qualities of locks are out there. You know that they need to buy a better quality lock and they need to buy a better quality, you know recovery product or service and that your ransomware insurance protection plan doesn't really cover all the costs if needed, you know.
0:27:34.720 --> 0:27:35.570
Muneer Mubashir
Umm.
0:27:35.920 --> 0:27:45.310
Rens, Erwin van
And they will find that one PC was not protected with, you know with with your anti malware product and then you know, deny the claim. All these kind of things.
0:27:46.890 --> 0:27:51.920
Rens, Erwin van
So yeah, but, but, you know, awareness creation is always the best sales person.
0:27:53.850 --> 0:28:1.20
Rens, Erwin van
And you know, doing a pen test or running a tool and it doesn't necessarily need to be a pen test, but if you have a tool out there.
0:28:2.340 --> 0:28:11.110
Rens, Erwin van
You know that can that can do, you know, show a couple of scenarios, show show with people of areas where your environment is not protected properly.
0:28:13.150 --> 0:28:18.40
Rens, Erwin van
You know that will that will help getting getting some more.
0:28:19.890 --> 0:28:24.270
Rens, Erwin van
A priority with with decision makers in the company to to actually do something about it.
0:28:25.330 --> 0:28:27.200
Rens, Erwin van
Right and it.
0:28:35.650 --> 0:28:35.980
Muneer Mubashir
There.
0:28:29.120 --> 0:28:49.630
Rens, Erwin van
It's also about how much of that effort is actually outsourced in a company. I mean, if I am, if I'm a company, and if I if I have hired you guys for my ADC S implementation and we've made a contract and an agreement that it's gonna be secure and safe and everything else, you know then.
0:28:52.210 --> 0:29:1.100
Rens, Erwin van
I would be extremely surprised if if some other company comes in and does a test and shows that it's still leaky somewhere so.
0:29:1.670 --> 0:29:2.800
Muneer Mubashir
Mm-hmm.
0:29:3.220 --> 0:29:8.130
Rens, Erwin van
But what I do see is that that quite some suppliers.
0:29:9.850 --> 0:29:22.120
Rens, Erwin van
When they put their product on the, I mean go to any alterity tool out there, everything can be installed in minutes. It's all configured very easily. You only need to click a few things right. You only need to run setup and click OK.
0:29:23.880 --> 0:29:45.510
Rens, Erwin van
But the tailoring to that specific companies needs is always a lot is very difficult. And I what I see is that that tailoring usually is does not get done because the company they don't know what what what they need to do with that tool the the vendor just you know puts it in because they have only offered you know two hours of consulting in order to get it to run.
0:29:46.580 --> 0:29:58.650
Rens, Erwin van
And those have those have been consumed with the with the initial implementation and and then it needs a third party basically to show where that. There are still gaps that need to be fixed.
0:29:59.990 --> 0:30:25.440
Rens, Erwin van
So yeah, it I think it's a good idea if if you as a security supplier partner with an organization that can check up either up front to show a need or afterwards to show leftovers, right, leftover risks. Because I think it it it creates if you show that that after the fact that there are no leftover areas that it increases your credibility as a supplier.
0:30:36.700 --> 0:30:37.90
Muneer Mubashir
Umm.
0:30:27.80 --> 0:30:42.580
Rens, Erwin van
And also you know if you can show up front that there are some areas of concern, then it it it also shows that you know what you're talking about and that you are you are the the right party to to to partner with in order to get these areas fixed.
0:30:44.950 --> 0:30:50.490
Muneer Mubashir
Excellent, excellent. I know where we're past the I know we would go longer.
0:30:51.980 --> 0:30:54.570
Rens, Erwin van
I can go on for hours and hours, don't worry.
0:30:52.830 --> 0:31:18.230
Muneer Mubashir
Great. Yeah, go. No. Which is, which is great, which is This is why I I miss enterprise services. You know, I I missed that. And HP I I came from BMC to HP and then when I was at HP and we had all these sessions with Enterprise Services, I was like Oh my God, you know, this is so much intellectual capital in one room to, you know, to fix a product to improve a product, right. So, you know, I was always excited by that.
0:31:24.310 --> 0:31:24.600
Rens, Erwin van
Umm.
0:31:19.850 --> 0:31:24.710
Muneer Mubashir
So, so coming back to to PKI spotlight, just little briefly.
0:31:27.100 --> 0:31:37.600
Muneer Mubashir
Are you are you familiar with it? I know Carolyn was trying. I think there are some DXC conversations that were happening. Are you familiar with with PKI spotlight? What it does and?
0:32:4.270 --> 0:32:4.610
Muneer Mubashir
Umm.
0:31:37.700 --> 0:32:8.190
Rens, Erwin van
Well, not not Hans Jong. I I know a little bit about his existence and I know what it does. It it you know it, it checks it does, it checks and balances over your ADC S environment. You know the the configuration of your Adcs instance, you're PKI instance, your your CRL servers, you know your configuration, your configuration of your template, the security of it and you know the integration with AD for for that matter up to that part. So I know what it does and I think it's it's a great tool because.
0:32:8.270 --> 0:32:15.430
Rens, Erwin van
Again, out-of-the-box, if if you look at Microsoft instructions for installing a DCS, it's just click a few buttons and then off you go right.
0:32:15.990 --> 0:32:16.290
Muneer Mubashir
Umm.
0:32:17.880 --> 0:32:38.400
Rens, Erwin van
If if you do it like that, then it's not secure. Quite simple. If you publish the default templates then you gotta major major hole out there. Yes, your endpoints will get certificates so they connect to your Wi-Fi, but anybody out there on the field can also do the same thing. There's no no preventing anyone from getting certificates from your your environment.
0:32:39.880 --> 0:32:45.220
Rens, Erwin van
If you know if they're willing to, if they're willing to put some effort in it, they can get, they can get into it very easily. So.
0:32:45.880 --> 0:32:46.260
Rens, Erwin van
Umm.
0:32:47.870 --> 0:32:57.580
Rens, Erwin van
I I think it it it it it it there's a need for it. I think everyone that that operates a serious a DCI engine should have it.
0:33:6.910 --> 0:33:7.240
Muneer Mubashir
Hmm.
0:32:58.520 --> 0:33:17.210
Rens, Erwin van
Because, you know it keeps getting updated with all and they just versions it. You know it's with new things are found. So then it it will it will start being able to detect those. So I think if you are serious about your ABCS environment then you need to put it onto your network next to your other monitoring and management tools.
0:33:18.310 --> 0:33:18.630
Muneer Mubashir
Mm-hmm.
0:33:19.190 --> 0:33:25.980
Rens, Erwin van
But I think that's that's also where Danish shifts, you know, you you first need an organization that is serious about their DC S environment.
0:33:26.950 --> 0:33:27.850
Muneer Mubashir
Mm-hmm.
0:33:26.970 --> 0:33:29.610
Rens, Erwin van
And in order to be serious about this, right?
0:33:31.490 --> 0:33:32.640
Muneer Mubashir
Right, right.
0:33:31.500 --> 0:33:37.760
Rens, Erwin van
And again, you know, detection is all detection and awareness creation is is all about it, right.
0:33:39.550 --> 0:34:9.680
Muneer Mubashir
Yeah, yeah. No, no, it's good. I mean, you are. You are familiar with an NL and we actually have a newer version of Spotlight that's going to be released next week. And to your point about more best practices where there's like, there's petite bottom, you know, detection in it automatically. So we'll you touched about NTLM authentication. I was talking to Michael Bruno and we're asking like, still NTLM, why is it as simple as disabling NTLM when it comes to petite?
0:34:21.950 --> 0:34:22.170
Rens, Erwin van
Yeah.
0:34:9.850 --> 0:34:28.160
Muneer Mubashir
Something like. No, it's not as simple because there's so many other providers that still, you know, rely on NTLM. So we'll have, we'll have a threat analysis engine and Petit program is the like the first one. You know that that gets that gets evaluated. We're also introducing some, you know, template misconfiguration checks out-of-the-box.
0:34:29.150 --> 0:34:49.190
Muneer Mubashir
As as well, so that continued improvement. So, So what what would be interesting is maybe get your take on on on that if you if you can join us next week, it's Tuesday, Tuesday 10:30 Pacific. If it's not too late for you. So we'll have the what's new section then?
0:34:54.630 --> 0:34:55.70
Muneer Mubashir
Yeah.
0:34:50.140 --> 0:35:4.600
Rens, Erwin van
It's it's 5:00 PM over here. I am about 8 hours ahead of you, 8 or 9 hours ahead of you. So some of all somebody other webcasts that Kelsey's organizing. And I've also mentioned to her that it it usually too late. There's a far beyond my working hours.
0:35:7.700 --> 0:35:8.80
Muneer Mubashir
OK.
0:35:12.60 --> 0:35:12.290
Muneer Mubashir
Yeah.
0:35:5.370 --> 0:35:12.440
Rens, Erwin van
I'll see if I can join in, and otherwise I will just look at the at the replay 'cause. I can always get to your website and get them replay no problem.
0:35:13.250 --> 0:35:13.580
Muneer Mubashir
OK.
0:35:13.630 --> 0:35:17.520
Rens, Erwin van
So yeah, I'll, I'll. I'll make sure that I I give some feedback from it.
0:35:40.960 --> 0:35:41.650
Rens, Erwin van
Yes, exactly.
0:36:8.830 --> 0:36:9.140
Rens, Erwin van
Yeah.
0:35:41.710 --> 0:36:13.320
Muneer Mubashir
Yeah. Who? Yeah, who came from, you know, spent some time at at Bank of America as well. So he he knows PI's from a customer and now is developing some of those best practices for us as well. Kind of walks through this and and his thing was like, I was in a room with the CSO and the pen tester, and they asked me, are you the PKI guy, is this your PKI? And he goes. Yeah. And that's basically what he shares. He shares his experience and he goes and he's a really good Vicki person, really.
0:36:17.540 --> 0:36:17.920
Rens, Erwin van
Hmm.
0:36:27.20 --> 0:36:27.270
Rens, Erwin van
Yeah.
0:36:36.710 --> 0:36:36.990
Rens, Erwin van
Yeah.
0:36:39.630 --> 0:36:40.150
Rens, Erwin van
Absolutely.
0:36:13.380 --> 0:36:43.540
Muneer Mubashir
The great guy and extremely intelligent knows what he's talking about and and he goes. It is hard for companies to just keep a handle on everything that's happening in the PKI, especially the larger they get and. And that's why he's like excited and he put together that demo for us because he was like, this is me and I wanna show how and he's like excited to share. So we'll we'll share some of those snippets as well you know going into it we're past the hour we could talk for for forever.
0:36:43.800 --> 0:36:49.170
Muneer Mubashir
A few things. Is it OK if we have schedule a follow up whenever you have a few?
0:37:0.580 --> 0:37:1.150
Quelsea Johnson
I don't know.
0:37:0.790 --> 0:37:1.190
Muneer Mubashir
Alright.
0:36:48.50 --> 0:37:7.780
Rens, Erwin van
No. Yeah, we could. We could do that. I I have to. I have to move. I have to move, you know, my my duties in the late evening is to prepare dinner, and that duty is 10 minutes late already. So I have to go start doing that. Otherwise you, you'll get my wife on the screen next time. And then if you don't want that.
0:37:16.220 --> 0:37:16.480
Rens, Erwin van
Yeah.
0:37:8.630 --> 0:37:26.590
Muneer Mubashir
I I know I know how that hurt. I know how that works. I I I pushed my lunch making duties this morning for my kids because it's we're we're at different times zones. It's morning, kids go and I, you know, lunch. I was like, I'll, I'll deliver the lunch this morning and my daughter left. Like, I'll drop it so. So I know it works. Thank you.
0:37:24.770 --> 0:37:54.560
Rens, Erwin van
Yeah, but I think I think we I of you know big illusions is doing a great job of creating more awareness and with that awareness you create momentum and as always a challenge between how much free consulting do you give out, right with that with webinars like this, yeah, you know and how how much do you eventually want to put into a, you know a commercial package because we still have to put some bread on the table, right.
0:37:55.480 --> 0:38:8.260
Rens, Erwin van
And yes, you know the default configurations creating default strengthenings is is good hardening's is good but the other side they're still has to be a commercial angle to it and that's that's a balance that you guys have to find.
0:38:9.580 --> 0:38:9.990
Josh Sommer
Yeah.
0:38:10.370 --> 0:38:10.630
Quelsea Johnson
Yeah.
0:38:10.460 --> 0:38:14.810
Muneer Mubashir
Absolutely. Absolutely. Thank you. Thank you for your time. Enjoy the evening with your family.
0:38:14.790 --> 0:38:25.980
Rens, Erwin van
Welcome. I will share the I will share the video with you because I don't think you can reach it right now, but as soon as it's done and I will share it and I will make it available to you.
0:38:27.250 --> 0:38:27.820
Muneer Mubashir
Excellent.
0:38:28.130 --> 0:38:28.440
Rens, Erwin van
Great.
0:38:27.950 --> 0:38:29.230
Quelsea Johnson
Yes, thank you. Alright.
0:38:26.810 --> 0:38:29.550
Josh Sommer
Thank you, Erwin. It was really nice to meet you face to face.
0:38:29.960 --> 0:38:30.830
Quelsea Johnson
Nice to meet you.
0:38:30.500 --> 0:38:31.60
Josh Sommer
Really nice.
0:38:30.200 --> 0:38:31.560
Rens, Erwin van
Thanks. Bye, bye.
0:38:32.150 --> 0:38:32.580
Quelsea Johnson
Bye.
0:38:32.450 --> 0:38:33.30
Josh Sommer
Bye bye.
0:38:32.560 --> 0:38:33.140
Muneer Mubashir
Bye bye.
